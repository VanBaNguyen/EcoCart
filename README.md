- OpenAI API key

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VanBaNguyen/EcoCart.git
   cd EcoCart/backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   PORT=5057
   ```

4. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5057`

### Frontend Setup (Browser Extension)

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Load the extension**
   - **Firefox**: Open `about:debugging`, click "This Firefox", then "Load Temporary Add-on" and select `manifest.json`

3. **Configure permissions**
   The extension will request permissions for:
   - Active tab access (to read current page)
   - Local storage (for cart persistence)
   - Backend API access (for environmental analysis)

## üì± Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Navigate to Amazon**: Visit any Amazon product page
2. **Open EcoCart**: Click the EcoCart extension icon
3. **View EcoScore**: See the environmental impact rating (1.0-5.0)
4. **Find Alternatives**: If score < 3.0, click "Find Eco Alternatives"
5. **Browse Options**: Swipe through sustainable alternatives
6. **Build Cart**: Add preferred items to your eco-friendly cart
7. **Shop Responsibly**: Make informed environmental choices

### EcoScore Interpretation

- **üü¢ 4.0-5.0**: Highly sustainable (durable materials, long lifespan, minimal waste)
- **üü° 3.0-3.9**: Mixed/unknown materials, partial recyclability, average footprint
- **üî¥ 1.0-2.9**: Predominantly single-use plastic, limited recyclability, short lifespan
